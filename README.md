# TableViewCellWithCollectionViewPaginationExample
A simple example with a collection view with pagination and a page control inside a tableview cell.

This is just a simple project I made to test how I could solve a challenge for another app of mine. Since I didn't manage to find any good solutions for the problem I decided to share this.
